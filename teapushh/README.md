# ASCII Art Generator

This is a simple Node.js application that uses `figlet` to convert text into ASCII art.

## Getting Started

First, run the server:


npm start


Open [http://localhost:3000/?text=YourTextHere](http://localhost:3000/?text=YourTextHere) with your browser to see the result. Replace `YourTextHere` with any text you want to convert to ASCII art.

## How It Works

You can start editing the server behavior by modifying `server.js`. The server auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses `express` for handling HTTP requests and `figlet` for generating ASCII art from text.
